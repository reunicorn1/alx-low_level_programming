# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

make is a utility that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code. It reads files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
A Makefile is a simple way of organizing code compilation. It contains a set of rules used to build an application. These rules describe the dependencies between files and provide actions that need to be executed to update files.

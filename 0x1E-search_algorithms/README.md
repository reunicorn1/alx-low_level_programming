# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

Searching algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used to retrieve information from data structures. There are two main types of searching algorithms: linear search and binary search.
Linear Search: This is the simplest type of search algorithm. It works by sequentially checking each element in a list until it finds a match or exhausts all possibilities. It's not very efficient for large lists, but it's straightforward and works on both sorted and unsorted lists.
Binary Search: This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing a sorted list in half and determining which half of the list the desired value is in. This process continues until the value is found or until there are no more elements to search. Binary search is much more efficient than linear search for large, sorted lists, but it requires the list to be sorted in advance.
Remember, the efficiency of a search algorithm is often measured in terms of its time complexity, which describes how the running time of the algorithm grows as the size of the input grows.
